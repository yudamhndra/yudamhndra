<h2> Hey there! I'm Yuda 👋🏼</h2>

I'm an undergrad at Gadjah Mada University studying Applied Software Engineering Tech. My jam is AI and full-stack development. Backend is my forte - I've got mad skills with modern frameworks like Django and Laravel, whether it's Python or PHP. I'm no stranger to databases either, having worked with RDBMS like MySQL and SQLite on the regular.

When it comes to AI, I know my way around libraries like YOLO. Give me some user requirements, and I'll whip up some clean code, no sweat. Agile methodologies like Scrum? Been there, done that. Waterfall? Yeah, I've rocked that too.
